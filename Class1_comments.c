Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrWIlIVZHB0&list=PLqJK4Oyr5WSjjEQCKkX6oXFORZX7ro3DA&index=2

My code in C:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    // to make comments in C you need use two bars before the text if you'll comment a single line
    // Now, to make comments with blocks in C you need use at the beginning /* and at the end */
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
